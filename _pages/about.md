I am a PhD student in DSA Thrust of the Information Hub at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Xinlei He](https://xinleihe.github.io/) . I am interested in pursuing the convergence of beautiful theory and practical methodology in the security and privacy aspects of large lannguage models.
